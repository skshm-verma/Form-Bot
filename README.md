## Description
Welcome to **FormBot**! üéâ 
FormBot is an innovative workspace where users can create their own custom forms, which act like interactive bots. These bots will engage with public users by asking questions, displaying media, and collecting responses. All collected responses are securely stored in the database for future analysis.

## üåü Features

- **Landing Page**: A welcoming landing page where users can navigate to the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** pages.
- **User Dashboard**: Upon signing in, users are greeted with a personalized dashboard where they can easily manage their forms and folders.
- **Folder Creation**: Organize your forms efficiently by creating folders. Forms can reside inside folders or be directly accessible from the dashboard.
- **Form Creation**: Dive into the **TypeBot** workspace to create engaging forms. The workspace includes:
  - **Bubbles**: Use bubbles to ask questions or display videos, images, and GIFs.
  - **Inputs**: Pair bubbles with relevant input chips to collect user responses.
- **Flow Section**: Customize the flow of your form by selecting and arranging bubbles and inputs.
- **Theme Section**: Personalize your form's appearance by choosing from multiple themes.
- **Response Section**: View and analyze the responses from public users, though initially, no responses will be displayed.

## üíª Technologies Used

FormBot is built using the **MERN stack** and other powerful technologies:

- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and form responses.
- **Express.js**: To handle backend routing and API requests.
- **React.js**: For creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: As the server-side runtime environment.
- **Vanilla CSS**: For styling the application, providing a clean and responsive design.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.
- **bcrypt**: To securely hash and store user passwords.
- **react-hot-toast**: For real-time notifications and alerts.
